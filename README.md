# Angular-WikipediaBlog

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.2.

## About

Small Angular application developed for exercise purposes, as part of an Angular bootcamp created by [DIO](https://github.com/digitalinnovationone). The content is dynamically fetched from randomly selected Wikipedia articles, and when an article doesn't contain an image, a placeholder image is assigned from [Cat as a service (CATAAS)](https://cataas.com/).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## About

Small Angular application developed for exercise purposes, as part of an Angular bootcamp created by [DIO](https://github.com/digitalinnovationone). The content is dynamically fetched from randomly selected Wikipedia articles, and when an article doesn't contain an image, a placeholder image is assigned from [Cat as a service (CATAAS)](https://cataas.com/).
